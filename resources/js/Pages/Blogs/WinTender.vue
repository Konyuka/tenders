                                        Any organization or business growing is
                                        likely to bid for a tender at some
                                        stage. This can be in aim of getting a
                                        new contract or continuing to work with
                                        the same supplier.

                                        This inevitably comes with stiff
                                        competition, for every tender at stake.
                                        It is therefore important, as a business
                                        person or supplier to learn how to stand
                                        out and stand a chance to win a tender
                                        with many bids.

                                        The truth is, both in the public and
                                        private sectors, tendering is a sure way
                                        to expand and grow as a business. The
                                        tendering process is, therefore, a
                                        competition, and without the right
                                        knowledge on how to win a tender, one
                                        may easily lose.

                                        For starters, identify the right
                                        tendering opportunity. When applying for
                                        a tender, ensure that your business can
                                        confidently deliver on the tender before
                                        applying for it. Consider factors like
                                        competitors and anticipate the terms
                                        they are likely to come up with in order
                                        to have the upper hand. It is also
                                        important to have a good background
                                        evaluation of the company or
                                        organization; this includes their
                                        experiences and differentiators. It will
                                        help you decide if the tender is a good
                                        addition to your organization.
                                    </p>

                                        Another important tip is to have great
                                        tender writing skills. In a process with
                                        so many applications, persuasion is key.
                                        It is important to be eloquent, direct,
                                        and account for every remark made.
                                    </p>

                                        The most important of all is to ensure
                                        that you meet all the requirements of
                                        the things the buyer is actually looking
                                        for. Being aware of the evaluation
                                        criteria is key. For both public and
                                        private sectors, one must have the
                                        following to increase their chances;
